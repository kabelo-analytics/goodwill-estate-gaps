# Goodwill Estate Gaps – Rebuilt Data-Driven PRD & Analytics Demo (Portfolio 2026)

A rebuilt portfolio project based on my original **SuccessorX** product pitch (2020–2023).

This repository demonstrates how data analysis and business/product thinking can be combined to validate an
accessible mobile estate-planning solution for South Africa.

The project focuses on how evidence (market statistics, gender gaps and poverty correlations) informs
product strategy, feature prioritisation and commercial models.

## 📌 Project Overview

Goodwill Estate Gaps is a proposed mobile application designed to make basic estate planning accessible
to low- and middle-income households in South Africa.

As Product Owner / Analyst at SuccessorX, I explored:

- B2C models (direct will creation and payments),
- B2B2C distribution (vouchers and partner channels),
- tiered products and managed services (execution fees and lead generation).

The original initiative was paused due to funding constraints, low early uptake and structural barriers
such as legacy legal systems, mandatory lawyer involvement and the inability of AI tools to legally bind wills.

This rebuilt notebook showcases how data-driven decision making supports product and business design.

## 🎯 Problem Context

A large proportion of South Africans die without a valid will, which leads to:

- long estate administration delays,
- family disputes and conflict,
- high legal and executor fees,
- loss of intergenerational wealth.

The problem is more severe among lower-income households and shows a strong relationship with poverty.
A persistent gender gap is also visible in will adoption.
