    "# Goodwill Estate Gaps – Rebuilt Data-Driven PRD & Analytics Demo (Portfolio Piece 2026)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "Rebuilt portfolio project from my SuccessorX role (2020–2023). As Product Owner / Analyst, I analysed estate‑planning\n",
    "market statistics in South Africa and hypothesised B2C and B2B2C delivery models (payment gateways, vouchers,\n",
    "tiered products and managed services with execution fees and lead generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original initiative was paused due to funding constraints, low early uptake and structural barriers\n",
    "(legacy legal systems, mandatory lawyer processes, and the inability of AI tools to legally bind wills).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook rebuilds the work to demonstrate data‑driven decision making, business analysis and Python‑based\n",
    "exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key skills demonstrated\n",
    "- Market hypothesis validation\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis\n",
    "- Gender and poverty gap analysis\n",
    "- Visual analytics using matplotlib and seaborn\n",
    "- PRD structuring driven by evidence\n",
    "\n",

    "- Save this notebook as `.ipynb`\n",
    "- Export generated images for documentation\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Aligned to SDG 1 (No Poverty). Approximately 70% of South Africa’s working population does not have a valid will.\n",
    "Women are disproportionately excluded and households face increased risk of family feuds under intestate\n",
    "succession. Typical will‑drafting costs range from R500 to R5,000, while estate administration fees average\n",
    "3.5% plus VAT. COVID‑19 created significant backlogs and operational delays. Long queues and paper‑based\n",
    "processes remain a major barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Customers Need a Will\n",
    "- Reduced family conflict and disputes\n",
    "- Greater gender inclusion and control over assets\n",
    "- Ability to appoint an executor\n",
    "- Faster and more predictable estate closure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge & Inspiration\n",
    "The goal is to help emerging households create and protect a legacy. High costs, COVID‑related uncertainty and\n",
    "limited disposable income highlight the need for low‑friction and affordable estate planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vision / Purpose\n",
    "Radically accessible estate planning on any mobile device.\n",
    "**Your Life, Your Legacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values\n",
    "- Compassion through creativity\n",
    "- Authenticity and humility\n",
    "- Lifelong learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extreme User Persona – Elizabeth Sithole\n",
    "- 48 years old, Xhosa speaking\n",
    "- Restaurant worker, R7,000 per month\n",
    "- Limited technology confidence\n",
    "- Assets approximately R225,000\n",
    "- Frustrations: high legal costs, COVID uncertainty, lack of guidance\n",
    "- Currently has no will\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Will Creation Flow\n",
    "1. Add personal details  \n",
    "2. Capture beneficiaries  \n",
    "3. Capture assets  \n",
    "4. Decide allocations  \n",
    "5. Nominate executor  \n",
    "6. Print, sign and store  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Were Working On\n",
    "Multilingual conversational assistant (for example, Sesotho support).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- Simple, familiar chat‑style interface\n",
    "- Anonymity and privacy\n",
    "- Secure end‑to‑end encrypted storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights from Data\n",
    "EDA shows persistent no‑will rates (≈66% in 2024), a widening gender gap, and a strong relationship between\n",
    "poverty and the absence of a will. This implies that mobile‑first solutions must specifically target lower‑income\n",
    "households, while accounting for legal and institutional barriers that slow digital adoption.\n"
